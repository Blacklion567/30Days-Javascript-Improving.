    Primitive Data Types
    Primitive data types in JavaScript include:
    *1. Numbers - Integers, floats
    *2. Strings - Any data under single quote, double quote or backtick quote
    *3. Booleans - true or false value
    *4. Null - empty value or no value
    *5. Undefined - a declared variable without a value
    *6. Symbol - A unique value that can be generated by Symbol constructor
    */
    //#EXAMPLE

    let number = 10 + 10.0; //Integers, floats
    console.log(number);

    let string = "Jade ivan";
    console.log(string); //String

    let boolean = true;
    console.log(boolean); //true
    let boolean1 = false;
    console.log(boolean1); //false

    let thisNull;
    console.log(thisNull); //Null

    let undefined;
    console.log(undefined); //undefined

    /*
    Non-primitive data types in JavaScript includes:
    *1. Objects
    *2. Arrays

    Now, let us see what exactly primitive and non-primitive data types mean.
    Primitive* data types are immutable(non-modifiable) data types. Once a primitive data type is created we cannot
    modify it.
    */
    //#EXAMPLE

    let string1 = "JavaScript";
    console.log(string1);

    let numOne = 3;
    let numTwo = 3;

    console.log(numOne == numTwo); // true

    let jS = "JavaScript";
    let pY = "Python";

    console.log(jS == pY); //false

    let onLight = true;
    let offLight = false;

    console.log(onLight == offLight); // false

    /*
    ### Non-Primitive Data Types

    *Non-primitive* data types are modifiable or mutable. We can modify the value of non-primitive data types after it
    gets created.
    Let us see by creating an array. An array is a list of data values in a square bracket. Arrays can contain the same
    or different data types. Array values are referenced by their index. In JavaScript array index starts at zero. I.e.,
    the first element of an array is found at index zero, the second element at index one, and the third element at
    index two, etc.
    */

    let number1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    number1[0] = 10;
    console.log(number1); //[ 10, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]

    /*
    As you can see, an array, which is a non-primitive data type is mutable. Non-primitive data types cannot be compared
    by value. Even if two non-primitive data types have the same properties and values, they are not strictly equal.
    */

    let number2 = [1, 2, 3];
    let number3 = [1, 2, 3];

    console.log(number3 == number2); // false

    let oneUser = {
    name: "Jade Ivan",
    role: "Programming",
    country: "Philippines",
    };

    let twoUser = {
    name: "Bandev",
    role: "programmer",
    country: "Philippines",
    };
    console.log(oneUser == twoUser); // false

    /*
    Rule of thumb, we do not compare non-primitive data types. Do not compare arrays, functions, or objects.
    Non-primitive values are referred to as reference types, because they are being compared by reference instead of
    value. Two objects are only strictly equal if they refer to the same underlying object.
    */
    let number4 = [1, 2, 3];
    let numbers = number4;

    console.log(number4 == numbers); // true

    let userOne = {
    name: "Asabeneh",
    role: "teaching",
    country: "Finland",
    };

    let userTwo = userOne;

    console.log(userOne == userTwo); // true
